# File Upload Simulator â€“ Frontend Take-home Test

Reflection Questions

1. What did you choose to mock the API and why?
   I used a custom mock implementation based on setTimeout and in-memory storage. This gave me full control over task timing, cancellation, and error simulation without relying on external libraries like msw.

2. If you used an AI tool, what parts did it help with?
   I used AI assistance for architectural suggestions and performance considerations, but I personally designed and implemented the core logic including polling, retry control, and cancellation handling.

3. What tradeoffs or shortcuts did you take?
   I chose to use custom hooks and native state instead of a full state management library like Redux or Zustand, to keep the project lightweight and easy to understand in a short time frame. Error messages and accessibility were kept minimal to focus on the task's core logic.

4. What would you improve or add with more time?
   Add unit and integration tests
   Add file queue with progress bars

5. What was the trickiest part and how did you debug it?
   Handling retry logic and avoiding stale state in poll(). I initially used useState directly, which led to outdated task data during async polling. I fixed it by tracking the latest task state using useRef to ensure polling stops immediately after status changes.
